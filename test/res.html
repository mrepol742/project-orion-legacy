The plot is quite simple: people turn into monsters, humanity has to survive, but in the midst of it, Sweet Home asks one important question \"What does it mean to be human?\" and explores it throughout all the episodes. It shows the best and the worst side of humanity - the will to survive that can unite or turn people against each other; the will to be humane as a way of fighting against the circumstances, but also using the horrifying situation as an excuse to abandon empathy.Despite the show claiming to be in line with thriller, horror and psychological genres, it falls closer to action as a leading one. The plot might seem simple, but it did an amazing job connecting the dots slowly presented. Quite a few times in the 2nd half I recognized the continuation of the plots and hints dropped in the beginning episodes. While the main question might not be answered and the ending could seem disappointing and unsatisfying for some, I found it to be the best possible approach. Any other take would fall short and seem forced. It definitely leaves a lot of room for possible season two, but lack of continuation of the story would not make me angry either.We are introduced to a brilliant cast of characters, that all have different stories to tell, that will resonate with the audience. In a short period of 10 episodes, I've got to see well built character development not only for Cha Hyun Soo, but also for many side characters. While I strongly disagreed with many of the character's decisions and behaviors, at the same time I could understand their reasoning behind it. If I had to pick my favorite characters (beside the star of the show Hyun Soo) I would pick empathetic Yoon Ji Su, brave Jung Jae Heon, resourceful Han Du Sik and level-headed Lee Eun Hyuk. That said, the chemistry between the whole cast was out of this world and they played off of each other well.The wise advice I could give to anyone before starting: don't expect dark psychological horror. Even though the show explores quite a few psychological themes, as I mentioned before, it leans more towards action in addition to some dark humor, especially in the beginning episodes. That said, the thing it has to be applauded for - the stakes were real. You know the shows, where you feel close to nothing when characters are in danger because you know they will survive anyway? Not here. Each problem presented to them, each encounter with monsters, each turn made me tense, scared, but also excited for what's to come.I'm not exactly one to pay attention to music in movies or shows, unless it truly catches my attention. Here, all the songs were extremely fitting and perfectly supported scenes they were played in. At first some choices might feel out of place, but as the drama progresses it starts to feel like a deliberate choice that somehow works. If I had to complain about anything, I'd say I was not the biggest fan of the CGI monsters at first. Since I was expecting a dark psychological horror like Strangers From Hell, the cartoon-ish like models with questionable motion put me off. The moment I accepted this is not what I signed up for and started to enjoy the action, I started to appreciate the design of the creatures. Some had comical features (we see an a*s once), but it balanced well the dreadful emotional moments happening among the characters.What's more, in the beginning episode the plot was not presented in a linear way, so it might be confusing. Later on the time jumps are barely happening and it's easier to follow the story.In conclusion: I cried a lot. I got attached to each and every character. I cared for what's going to happen to them. I was curious about their past stories and how they affect their current decisions and actions. The show simply made me engage in whatever was happening on the screen, to the point of me binge watching it for 10 hours and forgetting to eat.Warning: there is a lot of blood, some gore, story about child abuse and one for severe bullying. It talks about suicide and self harm. These themes might be too much for some viewers, so feel warned before giving it a shot.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}}}</script>

                                                    </div> Surprisingly hopeful and at times heartwarming tone for a
                                                    show full of monsters and death.<br><br>The show is more action and
                                                    the characters/relationships driven compared to my initial
                                                    assumption of it focusing on the story itself. The plot is quite
                                                    simple: people turn into monsters, humanity has to survive, but in
                                                    the midst of it, Sweet Home asks one important question "What does
                                                    it mean to be human?" and explores it throughout all the episodes.
                                                    It shows the best and the worst side of humanity - the will to
                                                    survive that can unite or turn people against each other; the will
                                                    to be humane as a way of fighting against the circumstances, but
                                                    also using the horrifying situation as an excuse to abandon
                                                    empathy.<br><br>Despite the show claiming to be in line with
                                                    thriller, horror and psychological genres, it falls closer to action
                                                    as a leading one. The plot might seem simple, but it did an amazing
                                                    job connecting the dots slowly presented. Quite a few times in the
                                                    2nd half I recognized the continuation of the plots and hints
                                                    dropped in the beginning episodes. While the main question might not
                                                    be answered and the ending could seem disappointing and unsatisfying
                                                    for some, I found it to be the best possible approach. Any other
                                                    take would fall short and seem forced. It definitely leaves a lot of
                                                    room for possible season two, but lack of continuation of the story
                                                    would not make me angry either.<br><br>We are introduced to a
                                                    brilliant cast of characters, that all have different stories to
                                                    tell, that will resonate with the audience. In a short period of 10
                                                    episodes, I've got to see well built character development not only
                                                    for Cha Hyun Soo, but also for many side characters. While I
                                                    strongly disagreed with many of the character's decisions and
                                                    behaviors, at the same time I could understand their reasoning
                                                    behind it. If I had to pick my favorite characters (beside the star
                                                    of the show Hyun Soo) I would pick empathetic Yoon Ji Su, brave Jung
                                                    Jae Heon, resourceful Han Du Sik and level-headed Lee Eun Hyuk. That
                                                    said, the chemistry between the whole cast was out of this world and
                                                    they played off of each other well.<br><br>The wise advice I could
                                                    give to anyone before starting: don't expect dark psychological
                                                    horror. Even though the show explores quite a few psychological
                                                    themes, as I mentioned before, it leans more towards action in
                                                    addition to some dark humor, especially in the beginning episodes.
                                                    That said, the thing it has to be applauded for - the stakes were
                                                    real. You know the shows, where you feel close to nothing when
                                                    characters are in danger because you know they will survive anyway?
                                                    Not here. Each problem presented to them, each encounter with
                                                    monsters, each turn made me tense, scared, but also excited for
                                                    what's to come.<br><br>I'm not exactly one to pay attention to music
                                                    in movies or shows, unless it truly catches my attention. Here, all
                                                    the songs were extremely fitting and perfectly supported scenes they
                                                    were played in. At first some choices might feel out of place, but
                                                    as the drama progresses it starts to feel like a deliberate choice
                                                    that somehow works. <br><br>If I had to complain about anything, I'd
                                                    say I was not the biggest fan of the CGI monsters at first. Since I
                                                    was expecting a dark psychological horror like Strangers From Hell,
                                                    the cartoon-ish like models with questionable motion put me off. The
                                                    moment I accepted this is not what I signed up for and started to
                                                    enjoy the action, I started to appreciate the design of the
                                                    creatures. Some had comical features (we see an a*s once), but it
                                                    balanced well the dreadful emotional moments happening among the
                                                    characters.<br><br>What's more, in the beginning episode the plot
                                                    was not presented in a linear way, so it might be confusing. Later
                                                    on the time jumps are barely happening and it's easier to follow the
                                                    story.<br><br>In conclusion: I cried a lot. I got attached to each
                                                    and every character. I cared for what's going to happen to them. I
                                                    was curious about their past stories and how they affect their
                                                    current decisions and actions. The show simply made me engage in
                                                    whatever was happening on the screen, to the point of me binge
                                                    watching it for 10 hours and forgetting to eat.<br><br>Warning:
                                                    there is a lot of blood, some gore, story about child abuse and one
                                                    for severe bullying. It talks about suicide and self harm. These
                                                    themes might be too much for some viewers, so feel warned before
                                                    giving it a shot. <p class="read-more"><a href="#"

                                                    planned. The ending was way different from the webtoon and there is
                                                    now more room for season 2. Every single monsters is so detailed and
                                                    so insane. I loved how they didn't show many things which the
                                                    webtoon had, now they show it in the season 2. Amazing acting from
                                                    Song Kang, Lee Shi Young, Lee Do Hyun and everyone. Everything
                                                    single scene was a slay. One of the best Korean drama of 2020. Must
                                                    watch! They way I panicked in every episode is very scary. <div
